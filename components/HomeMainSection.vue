      My journey into the world of programming began nearly 4 years ago, when I
      decided to try something new and learn new things everyday as a Frontend
      Developer. Since February 2022 I'm a professtional Frontend Developer in
      small software house based in Cracow - ReasonApps. In ReasonApps I worked
      with frontend layer of ecommerce and marketing platforms for influencers
      which you can see and read more about them in

      I'm open-minded person, I like to learn new things and create beautiful
      and user-friendly interfaces. I'm a big fan of SSR, because of better
      application performance which improves users perceprion of developed
      platform. Currently I try to get out of my comfort zone by learning and
      exploring new frontend technologies such as Vue and Nuxt and also backend
      stuff.
